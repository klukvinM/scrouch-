# Posture Detection System

A real-time posture detection system using computer vision to help maintain good sitting posture and prevent neck strain.

## Features

- Real-time posture detection using webcam
- Neck angle calculation and monitoring
- Visual feedback with status and angles
- Audio alerts for prolonged bad posture
- Timer display for bad posture duration

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam
- Audio output capability

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klukvinM/scrouch-.git
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

Move to the backend directory
```bash
cd backend
```
Then create and activate a virtual environment:

### Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Make sure you're in the backend directory and virtual environment is activated
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:8000/docs

4. Click the "Start Detection" button and allow webcam access when prompted.

5. Position yourself in front of the webcam
6. The program will:
   - Show your posture status (Good/Bad)
   - Display your current neck angle
   - Show a timer when in bad posture
   - Play an alert sound after 2 minutes of bad posture

## Posture Guidelines

- Good posture: Neck angle between 65° and 100°
- Bad posture: Neck angle outside this range
- Try to maintain your head aligned with your shoulders

## Troubleshooting

1. No webcam found:
   - Check webcam connection
   - Try changing camera index (0 or 1) in the code

2. Sound not playing:
   - Verify sound file exists in correct location
   - Check system audio settings
   - Try using winsound alternative (Windows only)

3. MediaPipe errors:
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Check if camera is properly positioned
